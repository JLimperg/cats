# Category Theory in Agda

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JLimperg/cats.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JLimperg/cats)

This is a formalisation of some standard notions of category theory in Agda.
Many of the definitions are stolen from John Wiegley's
[similar effort](https://github.com/jwiegley/category-theory) in Coq. Don't
expect anything to be 'production-ready' in any sense.
